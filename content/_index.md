# AUKI Tokenomics Simulation

This documentation describes the simulation of the AUKI tokenomics model available at [https://auki.cenit.finance/](https://auki.cenit.finance/).
Specifically, this simulation tests the behaviour of the tokenomics with the initial utility available in the AUKI Hagall network.

The simulation is written in Python and is designed to test various tokenomics designs and their behavior in a variety of simulated environments.

The simulation results are dependent upon:
 * A set of design parameters that define the tokenomics model
 * A set of hypotheses that define reasonable assumptions about the simulation environment and the behaviour of agents

In order to know more about the inner workings of the simulation, please refer to:
 1. [[Structure/Setup/Initial state|Initial state]]. How the simulation is initialized at the Token Generation Event.
 2. [[Structure/Take step/Step|Simulation Step]]. How the simulation state changes as it time advances.
