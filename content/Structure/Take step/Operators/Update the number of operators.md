The [[../../Agents/Operators]] leaving sell all their tokens

The overstaked [[../../Agents/Operators]] sell their surplus of tokens

If there are enough tokens in the [[../../Agents/AMM]] pool, do the following:

The undesrtaked [[../../Agents/Operators]] (below the margin from the design parameters) buy new tokens so they're not understaked anymore (buy to the new operator staking, not just to be inside the margin)

The new [[../../Agents/Operators]] buy tokens to stake

Update the number of [[../../Agents/Operators]] and their staking
